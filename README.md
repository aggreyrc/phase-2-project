# phase-2-project

This is a project to create a Single Page Application applying all the knowledge acquired in phase 2 of Moringa school program. The project requirements were as follows:

You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
The app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.

Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
Upon return of json from your POST request, a state update by a setState function is required!

Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled componentsLinks to an external site. or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. 

E-BOOK EXPLORER

The user can search for books by title or author.The user just types in the author name or the title of the book in the search field and the application will return books that match that search criteria.
